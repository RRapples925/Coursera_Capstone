Right now, New York City is perhaps the world's most diverse city. 
One of the key examples of its variety is in restaurants; you can find restaurants from every country, culture, and cuisine 
in the world in NYC. If someone desired to open a new restaurant, the immediate question is what kind and where. That is what my project 
aims to find. My project is geared to help prospective restaurant owners understand the types of restaurants that NYC needs, 
and those that have a chance of becoming major hits. This project could also appeal to anyone who is looking to analyze the 
psycological dynamic of various areas of the city, and what foods they like in relation to one another.
